# Restaurant Reviews App
This was a static restaurant reviews application that has now been converted into a mobile friendly application. 

To view maps on the application, you will need to replace `<your MAPBOX API KEY HERE>` in the main.js and restaurant_info.js file with a token from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/).

## How to run App
1. Click on the green button "Clone or Download".
2. Copy the link to clone the repository using git or download the zip.
3. Navigate to where the repository has been cloned or downloaded.
4. In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
5. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000` to view the application.
